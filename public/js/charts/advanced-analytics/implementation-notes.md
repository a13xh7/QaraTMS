2. **IntersectionObserver for Tooltips**
   - Implemented `TooltipManager.js` using IntersectionObserver API
   - Tooltips are only initialized when they enter the viewport
   - Significantly reduces initial render time for large tables

3. **DOM Query Caching**
   - Created `DOMHelper.js` to cache DOM query results
   - Prevents redundant DOM queries that cause layout thrashing
   - Provides convenient methods for DOM operations with built-in caching

4. **Consistent Debounce/Throttle Application**
   - Created standardized `debounce` and `throttle` utilities
   - Applied to expensive operations like scrolling, resizing, and filtering
   - Improved responsiveness during rapid user interactions

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implemented `PerformanceMonitor.js` to measure critical operations
   - Provides insights into render times, data processing, and event handling
   - Helps identify bottlenecks for further optimization

6. **Optimized Rendering Pipeline**
   - Introduced batch rendering for large datasets
   - Deferred non-critical operations to avoid blocking the main thread
   - Added appropriate animation frame scheduling for visual updates

7. **Memoization for Expensive Calculations**
   - Added memoization utility to cache results of expensive operations
   - Prevents redundant calculations when inputs haven't changed
   - Significantly improves performance for repetitive operations

### UX / Accessibility Improvements

1. **Replaced Alert/Confirm with Bootstrap Modals**
   - Created `ModalManager.js` to provide non-blocking modal alternatives
   - Implemented alert, confirm, and toast notification options
   - Added proper focus management for modals
   - Ensured keyboard accessibility for all modals

2. **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation**
   - Added focus styles for interactive elements
   - Ensured proper tab order with tabindex attributes
   - Added aria-live regions for dynamic content (filter counts)
   - Ensured focus is trapped in modals

3. **Added Non-Color Indicators for Accessibility**
   - Added striped patterns for value drops to help colorblind users
   - Added symbol indicators (▲/▼) alongside color changes
   - Included visually hidden text for screen readers
   - Implemented high contrast mode support

4. **Improved Tooltip Content Security**
   - Created `TooltipBuilder.js` to generate tooltips using DOM manipulation
   - Replaced string concatenation with secure textContent approach
   - Added accessible tooltips with proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensured proper focus handling for tooltip triggers

5. **Added ARIA Descriptions**
   - Included descriptive aria-label attributes for interactive elements
   - Added sr-only text for visual elements that convey meaning
   - Ensured all form controls have associated labels
   - Improved screen reader experience for data tables

### Data Integrity & Security Improvements

1. **XSS Protection**
   - Created `sanitizeHTML` utility function to prevent HTML injection
   - Replaced innerHTML with textContent for user-editable content
   - Implemented proper HTML sanitization for all string interpolation
   - Created secure DOM manipulation utilities in DOMHelper

2. **Added Type Safety**
   - Created `types.js` with comprehensive JSDoc typedefs
   - Defined clear interfaces for all data structures
   - Added type annotations to function parameters
   - Improved type checking throughout the codebase

3. **Implemented Immutable Data Patterns**
   - Created `DataTransformer.js` to process data without mutations
   - Used `deepClone` utility for safe object copying
   - Implemented non-destructive data transformation methods
   - Prevented side effects by avoiding direct object mutations

4. **Improved Data Validation**
   - Added input validation for user-provided data
   - Implemented defensive programming patterns
   - Added proper error handling for data processing
   - Used proper number parsing with fallbacks

### Quick Wins Implemented

1. **Optional Chaining**
   - Replaced verbose null checks with optional chaining syntax
   - Used nullish coalescing for default values
   - Simplified conditional logic throughout the codebase

2. **Consistent Use of Dataset**
   - Standardized attribute access using dataset properties
   - Replaced custom attributes with data-* attributes
   - Improved attribute consistency across elements

3. **Memoized Expensive Functions**
   - Added caching for getAllYears() function

   - Added cache key generators for complex arguments
   - Optimized frequently called functions

4. **Extracted Color Scale Generation**
   - Created pure function for color generation
   - Implemented memoization for color calculations
   - Separated color logic from rendering logic
   - Created consistent color utilities

## File Structure Improvements

- Created a logical folder structure separating concerns:
  - `common/`: Shared utilities and constants
  - `data/`: Data processing and transformation
  - `state/`: State management
  - `view/`: UI components and rendering
  - `controller/`: Business logic and event handling

- Externalized inline styles to dedicated CSS file
- Moved inline HTML templates to separate template files

## Migration Approach

- Created backward-compatible API through the migrator
- Implemented feature flags for gradual rollout
- Added detailed documentation for transitioning from legacy to new implementation

## Future Improvements
